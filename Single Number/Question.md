Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

# Input 1: 
    nums = [2,2,1]
# Output 1: 
    1

# Input 2: 
    nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
# Output 2:
    4

# Input 3: 
    nums = [1]
# Output 3:
    1
